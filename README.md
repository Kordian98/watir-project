
• Automate and attach automation test results(test execution log) in the
repository <b><== Cucumber automaticly creates a html-based raport with test reasults if we use "cucumber -f html -o 'logfile.html' features/happy-path.feature" command.</b>

• Add COMMENTS or implement the automation in such a way that would work
even with the form being in different locale/language (you can assume your
first/native language being the other language for the form unless it’s English) <b><== I focused on elements, not on text, so I predict tests will work with every language.</b>
  
  
My way to create this project:

1. I readed https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/ruby/ to get ruby basics
2. I found a project to base my work on https://www.agiratech.com/web-automation-testing-with-ruby-cucumber-watir/
3. I created project based on this one above and my own solutions
  

I feel like nothing more needs explainations, but if there appears any questions I will answer. :)

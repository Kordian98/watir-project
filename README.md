
• Automate and attach automation test results(test execution log) in the
repository <b><== Cucumber automaticly creates a html-based report with test reasults if we use "cucumber -f html -o 'logfile.html' features/happy-path.feature" command. Exemplary report available in this repo, name of file is logfile.html, direct link: https://github.com/Kordian98/watir-project/blob/master/logfile.html</b>

• Add COMMENTS or implement the automation in such a way that would work
even with the form being in different locale/language (you can assume your
first/native language being the other language for the form unless it’s English) <b><== I focused on elements, not on text, so I predict tests will work with every language.</b>
  
• Report (in a document attached in the GIT repository) any issue from the manual test, the form has (in your opinion), think about it as a real task you are given to test. <b><== Report is available in this repo, name of file is "manual-test-report.md", direct link: https://github.com/Kordian98/watir-project/blob/master/manual-test-report.md </b>
  
  
My way to create this project:

1. I readed https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/ruby/ to get ruby basics
2. I found a project to base my work on https://www.agiratech.com/web-automation-testing-with-ruby-cucumber-watir/
3. I created project based on this one above and my own solutions
  

I feel like nothing more needs explainations, but if there appears any questions I will answer. :)
